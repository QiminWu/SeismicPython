Schema css3.0
	Description ( "Center for Seismic Studies Schema Version 3.0 " )
	Detail {
		Modifications from original CSS documentation:
		0) units of calib vary according to the instrument, with wfdisc.segtype and instrument.rsptype indicating both sensor type and units
		1) Null values corrected for certain attributes.
		2) offdate added to primary keys for tables in which it occurs.
		3) endtime added to primary keys for tables in which it occurs.
		4) time made first primary key in origin for sorting.
		5) arid and orid added to foreign keys in assoc.
		6) made range values expression for automated testing
		7) added wfedit relation 12/3/93
		8) changed the primary key in sitechan to chanid, and added chanid as a foreign key in sensor to force joins of sitechan to go through sensor table.
		9) changed primary keys in moment and centryd table to orid.
		10) added calibration and stage tables 1/31/94
		11) changed primary keys in stamag to arid, magtype, sta, orid
		12) changed primary key in site to sta (no ondate, offdate)
		13) changed null values for origerr's covariant matrix
		14) changed definition of ndef for origins included from other catalogs

		16) added wftar table to accomodate tar tape waveform archiving 1/9/95
		17) changed all NONULL null values to reasonable values
		18) added wfrms table
		19) added wfmeas table for holding generic waveform measurements
		20) segment origin and stassoc etype field into two fields, etype and review, so that analyst review status can be kept in origin table
		21) add snetsta, anetsta, schanloc and achanaux tables to translate between foreign volumes of SEED or autoDRM into local databases.
		22) add specdisc table and associated attributes to support spectral estimation processing
		23) add rsprm to specdisc table

	Description ( "nominal calibration" )
	Detail {
		This is the conversion factor that maps digital seismic data to
		displacement, velocity, or acceleration, depending on the
		value of segtype or rsptype.  The factor holds true at the
		oscillation period specified by the attribute calper.  A
		positive value means ground motion (velocity,
		acceleration) increasing in the component direction (up,
		north, east) is indicated by increasing counts.  A
		negative value means the opposite.  Calib generally
		reflects the best calibration information available at the
		time of recording, but refinement may be given in sensor
		reflecting a subsequent recalibration of the instrument.
		See calratio.

Attribute calratio

	Description ( "calibration" )
	Detail {
		This is a dimensionless calibration correction factor
		which permits small refinements to the calibration
		correction made using calib and calper from the wfdisc
		relation.  Often, the wfdisc calib contains the nominal
		calibration assumed at the time of data recording.  If the
		instrument is recalibrated, calratio provides a mechanism
		to update calibrations from wfdisc with the new
		information without modifying the wfdisc relation.  A
		positive value means ground motion increasing in component
		direction (up, north, east) is indicated by increasing
		counts.  A negative value means the opposite.  Calratio is
		meant to reflect the most accurate calibration information
		for the time period for which the sensor record is
		appropriate, but the nominal value may appear until other
		information is available.

	Description ( "clipped flag" )
	Detail {
		This is a single-character flag to indicate whether (c) or
		not (n) the data were clipped.  Typically, this flag is
		derived from status bits supplied with GDSN or RSTN data,
		but could also be supplied as a result of analyst review.
