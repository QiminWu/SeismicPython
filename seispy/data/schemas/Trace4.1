Schema Trace4.1
	Description ( "Trace Manipulation and Processing Database" )
	Detail {
		This database provides the parameter
		information needed during standard processing of
		seismic waveform data.
		
		It is largely derived from the CSS 3.1 database,
		with additions which address specific trace manipulation
		issues, and the representation of traces in memory.
		The information contained in the central
		trace relation represents a join of many tables,
		in particular wfdisc, site, sitechan, sensor and instrument.

		This is an update to the Trace4.0 schema to bew compatible
		with the various larger strings in css3.1

Attribute vmodel
	String (30)
	Format ( "%-30s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "velocity model" )
	Detail {
		This character string identifies the
		velocity model of the earth used to compute the travel
		times of seismic phases. These are required for event
		location (if phase is defining) or for computing
		travel-time residuals.

	Null ( "-1.000" )
	Range ( "wgt >= 0.0 && wgt < 1.0" )
	Description ( "location weight" )
	Detail {
		This attribute gives the final weight
		assigned to the allied arrival by the location program. It
		is used primarily for location programs that adaptively
		weight data by their residuals.
	}

		the core schema there are just 9 distinct identifier keys:
		arid, chanid, commid, evid, inid, magid, orid, stassid,
		wfid. This table will also support application-specific
		keys as needed. Users are encouraged to use the
		dbgetcounter library routine to obtain a counter value.
